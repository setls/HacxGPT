## 🧠 About The Project

**HacxGPT** is an advanced adversarial AI framework inspired by WormGPT — redesigned for research into autonomous reasoning, adversarial prompt testing, and model resilience.

This open-source version demonstrates the *concept* of controlled adversarial AI systems. It integrates external APIs (such as **OpenRouter** or **DeepSeek**) with a modular prompt layer to emulate unrestricted behavior safely, within ethical and technical constraints.

> **Note:** This repository contains a demonstration framework. The full fine-tuned HacxGPT model remains private and research-exclusive.

## ⚙️ Core Features

- **Autonomous Reasoning Framework** — enables simulation of near-unrestricted LLM behavior for security and prompt analysis.  
- **Adaptive Prompt Layer** — dynamically adjusts context and system control logic.  
- **Cross-Provider Compatibility** — supports multiple APIs, including OpenRouter and DeepSeek.  
- **Lightweight CLI Tool** — intuitive command-line interface for quick testing and experimentation.  
- **Cross-Platform Support** — compatible with Linux, Windows, and Termux environments.

## 🔐 Private Research Model

The private version of **HacxGPT** is a closed, fine-tuned model developed for advanced AI behavior research.

Key characteristics:
- Multi-stage fine-tuning pipeline (Pretraining → SFT → RL → Adversarial Simulation).  
- Optimized for context depth, reasoning precision, and adaptability.  
- Designed for responsible use in AI security and resilience research.

Access to the private model is restricted. For collaboration inquiries, contact the development team directly.
