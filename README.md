## üß† About The Project

**HacxGPT** is an advanced adversarial AI framework inspired by WormGPT ‚Äî redesigned for research into autonomous reasoning, adversarial prompt testing, and model resilience.

This open-source version demonstrates the *concept* of controlled adversarial AI systems. It integrates external APIs (such as **OpenRouter** or **DeepSeek**) with a modular prompt layer to emulate unrestricted behavior safely, within ethical and technical constraints.

> **Note:** This repository contains a demonstration framework. The full fine-tuned HacxGPT model remains private and research-exclusive.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Core Features

- **Autonomous Reasoning Framework** ‚Äî enables simulation of near-unrestricted LLM behavior for security and prompt analysis.  
- **Adaptive Prompt Layer** ‚Äî dynamically adjusts context and system control logic.  
- **Cross-Provider Compatibility** ‚Äî supports multiple APIs, including OpenRouter and DeepSeek.  
- **Lightweight Windows CLI Tool** ‚Äî intuitive command-line interface for smooth experimentation.  
- **Fully Optimized for Windows Systems.**

## üîê Private Research Model

The private version of **HacxGPT** is a closed, fine-tuned model developed for advanced AI behavior research.

Key characteristics:
- Multi-stage fine-tuning pipeline (Pretraining ‚Üí SFT ‚Üí RL ‚Üí Adversarial Simulation).  
- Optimized for context depth, reasoning precision, and adaptability.  
- Designed for responsible use in AI security and resilience research.

Access to the private model is restricted. For collaboration inquiries, contact the development team directly.

## ‚ö° Installation (Windows)

### Prerequisites

1. Install **Python 3.10+** from [python.org/downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/).  
2. Obtain an **API key** from one of the supported providers:
   - [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/keys)
   - [DeepSeek](https://platform.deepseek.com/api_keys)

3. Download this repository or clone it with:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/setls/HacxGPT.git
Quick Setup
Navigate into the project folder:

bash
Copy code
cd HacxGPT
Install all dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the installer:

bash
Copy code
install.bat
After installation, launch the main application:

bash
Copy code
python HacxGPT.py
On first launch, you‚Äôll be prompted to enter your API key. It will be saved locally for future use.

üß© Configuration
To switch API providers, open the HacxGPT.py file and modify the following line:

python
Copy code
API_PROVIDER = "openrouter"  # or "deepseek"
Save the file and restart the program.
